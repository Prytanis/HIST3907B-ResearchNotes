# HIST3907B-ResearchNotes

Patrick Kelley, AKA Prytanis, AKA PrimeMinisterK

Data has been organized in this repo using a naming convention.
Folders are named M##E## where M## = Module number and E## = excercise number.
For example, M02E03 would be Module 2, Excercise 3.
This naming convention should make it trivial for the professor and any interested students (or [SSHRC](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx), for that matter) to locate the specific exercise.

Each Module will contain a markdown file named "Notes-M##E##.md" that should contain the course relevant notes for the excercise.  Additional notes may be present in each folder on a case-by-case basis, and the "Notes*.md" file should not be considered comprehensive.
