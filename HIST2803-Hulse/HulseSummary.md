# Hulse Summary

## The Assignment

Details for the assignment can be found in HIST2803ACourseOutlineWinter2015.doc.
Sir Edward Hamilton Westrow Hulse, Letters written from the English front in France between September 1914 and March 1915 (n.p.: Privately Printed) 1916.
The text can be found at: http://archive.org/details/letterswrittenfr00hulsrich
Consider what these letters reveal about Hulse’s experience of war. It is suggested that you select one or two themes to develop (for example, officer-man relations; professionalism; life behind the front lines; morale; ‘the front’; attitudes toward to the enemy; individual agency; attitudes toward death, etc.,.) 

A copy of the original text is saved under the following files:
* HulseLetters-B&W.pdf
* HulseLetters-Text-I01.txt Some cleaning was done on this file to use it in a word cloud.


## The Gantt Chart

I did not have sufficiently deep knowledge of the battlefield of World War One to understand the context of the letters.

I employed data visualization techniques to help me to better understand and to visualize, literally, Hulse's proximity to the battles of the war.

I chose to use a Gantt Chart to represent time and space.  Each bar represents the length of time of an event.  The top row for each month shows major, intense battles of the British Expeditionary Force.  In later iterations of the chart they are coloured in blue.  Rows showing Hulse's proximity to battle are named "At Front" or "At Rear".

Using a close read of the text I was able to contruct the timeline.  Sample text that provided reference material in the primary source to create the timeline, as well as the output Gantt Chart are shown in the following files:* 
* 20150226-HulseMethods-GanttChart.pptx (Power point presentation summarizing material)
* Chronology-v02.xlsx (Gantt Chart creation)
* P16.jpg and P79.jpg (Two examples of text with information about dates used to construct the Gantt Chart.)


## Method

When I began the close read and contruction of the Gantt chart I had no idea what I would find: not even an hypothesis.  What I found formed the thesis for my entire paper, and I referred back to chart frequently throughout the work.

Is your interest piqued?  I invite you to have a look at the paper to see what I found...

## Outcome

I received an A+ on the paper and was invited to give an opening portion of the lecture for one of the classes.  As video gamers might say, Data Viz FTW!

## Word Cloud

I also produced a word cloud for final paper just to give us a quick snapshot of what Hulse was writing about as a kind of distant reading method.  One is appended to the end of the paper.  Original images can be viewed:
