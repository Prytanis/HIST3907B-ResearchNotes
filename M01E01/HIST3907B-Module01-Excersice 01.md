##### Introductions
My name is Patrick Kelley.  I work as a securities trader for [TD Waterhouse][06].  I have my Canadian Securities license (CSC and CPH), my Derivitives, Futures, and Options trading license (DFOL), and my life insurance licence.  I also have seven years of  experience at the management level in marketing.  My resume with [MBNA Canada][04] and their marketing efforts gave me exposure to--and decision making authority for--one of the largest marketing operations in the country.

I am a father of two children, Sophia and Athena, and a husband to Yvonna.

##### Why Am I Taking HIST3907B?
Recent successes in trading have afforded me the opportunity to return to university to complete my BA.  With the normal obligations of being a homeowner and parent, I did not have the luxury of taking a leave of absense from work until recently.  Completing the degree is also unfinished business for me personally.  It is something that I've been wanting to bring closure to for a long time.

Furthermore, having a university degree is a prerequisite for my next professional goal.  I wish to achieve a professional desgnation as a Chartered Professional Accountant.  Information about the designation can be found at the Chartered Professional Accountants [website][01].

In addition, I also plan to complete my [PMP][03] through the [Project Managment Institute][02] soon after graduating from Carleton.  The PMP is becoming much more common as a necessary item for management level work, especially in the public sector and for companies that work with it.

I plan to combine the CPA with the PMP, allowing me to move rapidly towards my goal of reaching the upper levels of management in the financial sector quickly.  But first, I must complete my degree!

So far, this explains why I am sitting in a chair at Carleton in the history program, but not why I am taking Data Mining.  Most of my professional experience has been in marketing.  When I return to the workforce, many of the skills provided by the course will give me a distinct edge against my peers in my desired field.

Being able to communicate in meetings through the medium of info-graphics and the data visualizations we are dealing with will be a huge advantage in the professional sphere.  As a manager showig my staff how to create and utilize these tools, not just for reporting but also for pattern recognition, will be invaluable.  I can already imagine running network analyses on client product usage and profitabilty patterns.

The skills that I learn here, when added to those that I already possess, will make me a formidable financial manager.  I will be able to communicate more persuasively, recognize patterns more quickly and with greater certainty, and develop targetted solutions that my peers can not.  I short, I will be able to create what the corporate world likes to call 'vision' in ways that my peers will likely have never imagined.


##### What Do I Hope to Achieve?
I plan to build a new technical skill set and to learn to employ analytical methods and means of collaboration that will distinguish me from my peer group in my professional life.  I plan to do that by excelling on the various modules and assignments in the course.
I plan to develop a network of contacts through the faculty and student body that I can draw on once I return to the professional world.  I will do this by providing an exeptional example of professionalism, and by engaging with the assignments in as fun a way as possible.

My initial thoughts are that I could create or replicate a comparison of voting patterns in the United States.  The current wisdom is that the partisan divide in the US is a North-South cultural split.  However, this is quite false.  The divide seems instead to be caused by an urban-rural divide.

The urban-rural divide first became obvious to me during the 2000 presidential election while I was watching the election on television and referring to live-updating Choropleth state maps on the CNN website which had data down to the county level.

Here are some examples of what I might try to develop:
1. A Basic Choropleth Map

2. A Cartogram Map of the US
*The map of the 1892 election is too busy and not something that I would attempt to replicate.  Nor does this one bear directly on my proposed subject matter.*

3. 3D Overlay of Partisan Choropleth and Population Size
*The below chart is very similar to what I propose to (re-?)create.  I would use population density instead.*

##### Current and Target Digital Experience
Although I am relatively technology savvy compared to many people my age, there is still much left to achieve.
Sophisticated use of social media is my largest blindspot.  Hopefully some of the tools we utilize over the course of the semester will help me to develop them.

Ultimately, I would like to be able to produce original, informative videos for upload to public fora such as YouTube.  I would like to be able to use social media to effectively distribute and "market" those ideas so that they become as widespread as possible.  While this will likely never be much more than a hobby for me, it is something that I think I would very much enjoy.

Though the concept began as the desire to create and 'ethical will' for my daughters, I have come to believe that the project would be of immense value to the world if it were to be subscribed to by large populations, and therefore worth "marketing" on a large scale.

I hope that the suspense can be forgiven, but for the purpose of this assignment I will have to allow the ideas to remain unexpressed.  They are too extensive to be appropriately documented here.

Suffice it to say, that the ethical will is intended to be benign.  However, should I ever turn my new visualizaion and social media super powers to evil, you could looke forward to the following campaign poster:

Looking forward to the class,

Patrick Kelley
