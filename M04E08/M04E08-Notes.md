## Palladio Step by Step Notes

There are no co-ordinates easily available to put into spreadsheet.
The tutorial linked in the notes references a pre-existing set of coordiantes in a <i>previous</i> exercise from the other educational institution.
I have had to hack the url for the linked tutorial to find the <i>other</i> tutorial from the <i>other</i> institution.
http://hdlab.stanford.edu/doc/scenario-simple-map.pdf

I am now having to complete 3 different tutorials to complete this single excercise, one of which I had to find myself...

OK, so that just basically says: make it up.
Manually selected, data entered, and typed in goecoordinates by randomly selecting street corners in google maps.

CSV filename: HalifaxPubs.csv
Contains names of pubs that I created.  Fictional, but they sound like pubs that one might find in Halifax.  e.g. The Green Harp, Flatulent Hook

Entering data outputs: Data export.palladio.0.9.4.json


Got it to work, finally.
It's actually pretty cool.
Dots are dark grey on the map and difficult to see, but the objectives have been achieved.  In a perfect world I would continue to fiddle until the dots were more easily visible and dynamically labelled.
