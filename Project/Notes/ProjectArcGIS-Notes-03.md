Notes
During deformation in ScapeToad to Cartograms, it became very obvious that the shapefiles for 2004/2008 were very different from 2012.  It is most obvious along coastlines.
Bodies of water also had to be manually removed from 2004/2008.  They did not exist in the 2012 dataset.
Areas where this is most notable is in Florida and the Gulf Coast.
