I'm finding that as I mark up the text it become less and less legible.  I am required to keep open an original, unmarked version of the text open, and to mark up the TEI document in a second window on my computer.

I have chosen NOT to complete the flags inside tags.  The purpose of this exercise seems to be to learn how to tag a document for a close read, not to see if I can locate the geo-coordinates of a church references in an out of context primary document, for example.

Completed marked up filename: TEIScrpt04.txt
Renamed: TEIScrpt04.xml

After first attempt, when rendering in internet explorer the printout of the text stops inexplicably part way through the document.  I have check and all of my tags are closed properly.

There is no .XSL document given in the explanation for the excersice.  A search for the term on https://github.com/hist3907b-winter2015/module3-wranglingdata/tree/master/tei-hist3907 shows <b>no instances</b> of the extension prior to this point in the documentation for the exercise.  To make things even better, there are two differnt XSL files in the repo, so I don't know which one to use.

After having reviewed the page and most links, I can find no explanation of what the XSL file is or how it is meant to interac with the XML file.
