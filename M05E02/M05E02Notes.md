## The Web Page

Nearly all of the fonts on TypeConnection seem to be pay-to-play fonts.  This means that the site is nearly useless for the purpose of generating compatible fonts for the purpose of this exercise.  Further, it makes me wonder if TypeConnection is somehow sponsored or controlled by the international capitalist font conspiracy...

The two fonts that I selected seemed to be appropriate for one another, one being a little blockier than the other.  Titles should stand out, text should be easy to read.
